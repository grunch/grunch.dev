Maintaining a lightning node is not an easy task, there are serveral aspects that can go wrong that's why we must be very careful with the node management, my node does not have large amount of money but still is doing a good job routing payments and currently is well ranked on [web terminal](https://terminal.lightning.engineering/#/024b8019795ec753fcdb1eb21ecd319bfab6a8b05e017f357dc5f052a181fb8c91).

If you need a reliable routing lightning node you can open a channel to [grunch.dev](https://1ml.com/node/024b8019795ec753fcdb1eb21ecd319bfab6a8b05e017f357dc5f052a181fb8c91)
