In mid-2019 I wrote a paper called `Venezuela: From Hyperinflation to Hyperbitcoinization`, this writing gets more relevance today since El Salvador has become the first nation to [adopt Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/elsalvador/status/1402507585807433728) as legal tender.

I think that much of what I wrote more than two years ago needs revision but the main idea remains the same.

### Bitcoin whitepaper
All started with this 9 pages [paper](/bitcoin.pdf), you MUST read it.
