I'm a software engineer, Open source & Bitcoin supporter. I spend my time contributing to open source Bitcoin and Ligthning Network related projects, I want to help make Bitcoin better money and be easy to use for non technical people.

I've been working on **Lightning Network** projects since Q1 2018, currently I'm an independent consultant on Bitcoin/Lightning Network related projects, if you want to talk just DM me.
